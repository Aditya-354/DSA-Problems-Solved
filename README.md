# DSA PRACTICE IN C++

This repo contains various DSA problems solved from different platforms like LeetCode, GfG, etc. with structured and super-beginner-freindly documentation.

My preferred language: C++

## Arrays

[Arrays](https://github.com/Aditya-354/Interesting-DSA-Problems/tree/main/Arrays) are ADTs (Abstract Data Types)
- [Two - Sum](https://github.com/Aditya-354/Interesting-DSA-Problems/blob/main/Arrays/TwoSum.cpp)

**Platform:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

**Approach:** Hash map (store value already visited to check later on)

**Time Complexity:**  O(n) -- loop only once

**Space complexity:** O(n)



- [Missing in Array](https://github.com/Aditya-354/DSA-Problems-Solved/blob/main/Arrays/Missing_in_Array.cpp)

**Platform:** [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/missing-number-in-array1416/1?page=1&category=Arrays,CPP&difficulty=Easy&sortBy=submissions)

**Approach:** Simple for loop. Declare the variables as long long

**Time Complexity:** O(n)

**Space Complexity:** O(1)
