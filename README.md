# DSA PRACTICE IN C++

This repository contains solutions to various DSA problems from platforms like LeetCode, GfG, and others.
My focus is on writing clear, structured solutions along with concise approaches, patterns, and complexity analysis.

I’m still a beginner, so I often spend time exploring hints, reading discussions, or using AI assistance when needed.
The goal of this repository is not to showcase perfect first-attempt solutions, but to document my learning process and ensure I understand each problem deeply.

My preferred language: C++
