# DSA PRACTICE IN C++

This repo contains various DSA problems solved from different platforms like LeetCode, GfG, etc. with structured and super-beginner-friendly documentation. I DO NOT solve these questions on my own. I try for some time (probably hours), check hints, use AI, etc. But what's important is that I understand them. After all, I'm still a beginner.

My preferred language: C++

**PROBLEMS SOLVED:**

[Arrays](https://github.com/Aditya-354/Interesting-DSA-Problems/tree/main/Arrays) : **$$6$$**


## Arrays

[Arrays](https://github.com/Aditya-354/Interesting-DSA-Problems/tree/main/Arrays) are ADTs (Abstract Data Types)
* [Two - Sum](https://github.com/Aditya-354/Interesting-DSA-Problems/blob/main/Arrays/TwoSum.cpp)

**Platform:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

**Approach:** Hash map (store value already visited to check later on)

**Time Complexity:**  $$O(n)$$ -- loop only once

**Space complexity:** $$O(n)$$



- [Missing in Array](https://github.com/Aditya-354/DSA-Problems-Solved/blob/main/Arrays/Missing_in_Array.cpp)

**Platform:** [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/missing-number-in-array1416/1?page=1&category=Arrays,CPP&difficulty=Easy&sortBy=submissions)

**Approach:** Simple for loop. Declare the variables as long long

**Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$

**Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$



- [Remove Duplicates](https://github.com/Aditya-354/DSA-Problems-Solved/blob/main/Arrays/Remove_Duplicates_From_Sorted_Array.cpp)

**Platform:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/)

**Approach:** I used the two-pointers method. Using two variables *i*(keeps track of the unique values) and *j*(array traversal through the loop body). I struggled while solving this problem. I hope you do too.

**Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$

**Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$



- [Remove Elements](https://github.com/Aditya-354/DSA-Problems-Solved/blob/main/Arrays/Remove_elements.cpp)

**Platform:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)

**Approach:** Two Pointer method.

**Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$

**Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$



- [Plus One](https://github.com/Aditya-354/DSA-Problems-Solved/blob/main/Arrays/Plus_One.cpp)

**Platform:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/)

**Approach:** A two pointer approach where the carry keeps track of the carry from incrementing the digits. If the digit/last digit is 9, it is incremented to 10, and carry becomes 1.

**Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$

**Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$



- [Second Largest](https://github.com/Aditya-354/DSA-Problems-Solved/blob/main/Arrays/Second_Largest.cpp)

**Platform:** [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/second-largest3735/1?page=1&category=Arrays,CPP&difficulty=Easy&sortBy=submissions)

**Approach:** Searching

**Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$

**Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$
